# Ledger

## Overview
The `ledger` folder contains modules and subpackages related to the management and integrity of the StegVerse ledger system. This includes core ledger functionality, wallet management, token handling, event processing, and telemetry support.

## Key files or responsibilities
- `steg_ledger.py` – Main ledger management logic.
- `steg_ledger_core.py` – Core ledger operations and data structures.
- `ledger_integrity.py` – Functions or checks ensuring ledger consistency and correctness.
- `steg_token.py` – Handling of tokens within the ledger system.
- `steg_wallet.py` – Wallet management and operations.
- `steg_wallet_view.py` – Wallet view or interface layer.
- `events/` – Event-related modules, likely for ledger event handling or propagation.
- `telemetry/` – Modules related to telemetry and monitoring of ledger activity.
- `OBSELETE` – Deprecated or outdated components (review before use).

## How this fits into StegVerse
This folder implements the foundational ledger and wallet infrastructure critical to StegVerse’s secure and verifiable transaction system. It supports token management and event-driven updates, integrating with other StegVerse components to maintain a consistent and auditable state.

## Notes / TODO
- Document the specific role and API of each module in more detail.
- Clarify the contents and purpose of the `events` and `telemetry` subpackages.
- Review and clean up the `OBSELETE` file and any deprecated code.
- Add usage examples or integration points with other StegVerse subsystems.
