# Reports

## Overview
This folder contains reports and related data structures used within StegVerse-SCW. It serves as a centralized location for output files and organized subfolders that capture analysis, summaries, or other reporting artifacts generated by the system.

## Key files or responsibilities
- `stegverse_multi_autopatch_report.md`: A markdown report likely summarizing results or findings related to multi autopatching within StegVerse.
- `entities/`: Presumably contains entity-specific reports or data relevant to the reporting process.
- `guardians/`: Presumably contains guardian-specific reports or data relevant to the reporting process.

## How this fits into StegVerse
The reports folder aggregates outputs and structured data that document the state, results, or progress of various StegVerse components. It supports transparency, debugging, and analysis by providing accessible summaries and detailed information about entities and guardians.

## Notes/TODO
- Clarify the exact contents and format of the `entities/` and `guardians/` subfolders.
- Document the generation process and purpose of `stegverse_multi_autopatch_report.md`.
- Add guidelines for adding new reports or extending existing ones.
