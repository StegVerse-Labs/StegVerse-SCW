1) As of December 13, 2025, StegVerse's economic state appears minimal, with a total wallet balance of only 10.01 USD held under an unspecified or unassigned account ("None"). This indicates a very limited available liquidity or operational funds, suggesting either a nascent stage of economic activity or a depletion of resources. The integrity state cannot be fully assessed from the wallet snapshot alone, but the lack of diversified or clearly assigned balances may point to organizational or accounting issues.

2) Risks:
- Extremely low total funds (10.01 USD) limit operational capacity and financial resilience.
- Absence of designated accounts or clear ownership of funds may indicate poor financial governance or transparency.
- Potential vulnerability to economic shocks or inability to fund essential activities.
- Risk of loss or misallocation of funds due to unclear wallet/account structure.

3) Suggested next actions:
- Conduct a comprehensive audit to clarify account assignments and ensure proper financial governance.
- Develop a strategy to increase wallet balances through fundraising, partnerships, or revenue generation.
- Implement stricter wallet management protocols to improve transparency and accountability.
- Monitor economic indicators regularly to detect and respond to financial risks promptly.
