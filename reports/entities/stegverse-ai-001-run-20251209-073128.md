1) As of December 9, 2025, StegVerse's economic state appears critically underfunded, with a total wallet balance of only 10.01 USD held in an unspecified or unassigned account ("None"). This minimal balance indicates a lack of active funds or operational capital, suggesting potential economic stagnation or inactivity. From an integrity perspective, the absence of diversified or clearly allocated funds raises concerns about the system’s financial management and transparency.

2) Risks:
- Insufficient funds to support ongoing operations or development.
- Lack of clear account allocation may indicate poor financial governance.
- Potential vulnerability to economic shocks or inability to respond to emergent needs.
- Risk of loss of stakeholder confidence due to minimal and unclear financial status.

3) Suggested next actions:
- Conduct a detailed audit to clarify account assignments and financial flows.
- Develop a strategic plan to secure additional funding or revenue streams.
- Improve financial transparency by categorizing and documenting all wallet holdings.
- Engage stakeholders with a status update and roadmap to restore economic stability.
- Implement monitoring tools to track wallet activity and prevent further degradation.
